the gemara asks  and is it true that documents cannot be acquired through words but doesn t rabba bar yitz ak say that rav says  there are two types of documents the first type is where one says to others  take possession of this field for so and so and write the document for him as proof of the sale of the field in this case he may renege with regard to the document i e he may change his mind and tell them not to write it but he may not renege with regard to the field as the buyer has already acquired it

23
the gemara elaborates  what is the reasoning of the rabbis imposing is stated in the later verse   if ransom is imposed upon him  exodus   and imposing is stated in the earlier verse concerning a person who injures a pregnant woman causing her to miscarry   he shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him  exodus   this verbal analogy indicates comparison of the two halakhot   just as there with regard to compensation for causing miscarriage the evaluation is according to the monetary value of the injured party i e the fetus so too here the ransom is according to the value of the injured party

a person does not merit to learn from everyone and it is possible that the only suitable teacher for him lives outside of eretz yisrael and rabbi yosei reported in support of his position  it once happened that yosef the priest went to his teacher in tzeidan outside eretz yisrael to learn torah although the preeminent sage of his generation rabban yo anan ben zakkai lived in eretz yisrael

then they said to him  you declared also that the satiety of the rich will not suffer him to sleep what can this mean certainly it permits him to sleep in fact a man sated with food falls asleep more quickly than others solomon replied  i was speaking about those who possess the riches of the torah and not material possessions for example a man who is distinguished and wealthy in the knowledge of the torah will teach many students and disseminate his knowledge among the masses and he is satisfied in his knowledge of torah and when he dies the disciples he raised do not permit him to be forgotten they sit and labor in the torah the talmud the law and the aggadah quoting the law in his name and recalling him to mind constantly they do not permit him to sleep undisturbed in his grave

they journeyed from refidim and arrived in the desert of sinai etc the position of the verse is peculiar we have already heard in verse one that the israelites arrived in the desert of sinai why did the torah repeat it again perhaps we can explain this in terms of a statement in sanhedrin   that love has a tendency to disregard normal rules as a result of love what took place later may be reported earlier inasmuch as the day the israelites accepted the torah was the day that gd had been waiting for ever since he created the universe it is understandable that the torah reported the arrival of this day at the earliest possible moment this explains the emphasis of the torah on       on this day they arrived the arrival describes the meeting of the lover and his beloved heaven and earth both rejoiced that this day had arrived at last

some say a slightly different version of this story in which ameimar said to rav geviha  what is the meaning of ketura if it means tying ornamental knots by hand this is the act of a craftsman which is prohibited if it is referring to burning incense this too is prohibited as he produces a new scent rav ashi said  i said this halakha to rav geviha and i said it in the name of a great man rava that actually it is referring to burning incense which is permitted just as it is permitted to place meat on coals for roasting

the gemara suggests  come and hear an alternative proof for rav na man s opinion it is stated in a baraita   with regard to an ox that climbed on the back of another ox to kill it and the owner of the ox on the bottom came and removed his ox and the ox on top consequently fell and died the owner of the ox on the bottom is exempt from paying for the dead ox what is this ruling not stated with regard to a case where the attacker is a forewarned ox where there is no loss to the owner of the bottom ox since even if the owner of the ox on the bottom does not remove his ox he will eventually receive full restitution from the owner of the belligerent ox yet he is exempt from paying restitution for causing the death of the belligerent ox evidently he had the right to take justice into his own hands

rather what is different about damage to an ox caused by an ox and damage to an ox caused by a man so that babylonian judges can rule in these cases even though they are not ordained the difference is that we the judges of babylonia perform the agency of the judges of eretz yisrael just as we do with regard to the halakhot of admissions and loans as we are permitted to rule in those cases as agents of the ordained judges in eretz yisrael if so then in cases of damage caused to a person by a person and cases of damage caused to a person by an ox as well why not say that the judges of babylonia perform the agency of the judges of eretz yisrael just as it is with regard to the halakhot of admissions and loans

gemara  the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of this tanna as it is taught in the tosefta   that rabbi yosei son of rabbi yehuda said  admon and the rabbis did not disagree with regard to one who promises and apportions money for his son in law as a dowry and subsequently went bankrupt that the betrothed woman can say  my father apportioned money for me  what can i do

rather abaye s statement should be understood as follows  one mention of the prohibition is for an idol for which its typical manner of worship is similar to bowing in that the idol is worshipped in an honorable manner but bowing is not its typical manner of worship as it is not typically worshipped by bowing and one mention is a prohibition against bowing to an idol even if it is not similar to its standard manner of worship at all and one mention is to divide idol worship into categories

rava added  i will state my reason and i will state their reason i will state my reason  what is the reason for a cross beam to function as a conspicuous marker that separates the alleyway from the public domain so that the residents of the alleyway should know the boundary within which carrying is permitted and when placed diagonally the cross beam is not sufficiently conspicuous those who see people carrying in the section extending past the short side will think that one is generally permitted to carry in a public domain

17
ravina said a different explanation  with regard to a sukka since its mitzva is by torah law the sages were stringent however with regard to an alleyway since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance in order to permit carrying in an alleyway is only by rabbinic law the sages were not stringent

in the case of  one reading a scroll in a karmelit and some of the scroll unraveled into the public domain and some of it was  still  in his hand  if it unraveled outside of four ells  in the public domain  he turns it over on the writing face down and leaves it  this is  a decree lest all of it slip from his hand and he move it four ells  but if  it unraveled within four ells he rolls it towards him likewise if it unravels into a private domain he rolls it towards him  if  he was reading in a private domain and it unraveled into a public domain  if it came to rest there he turns it over on the writing but if it did not rest but was rather suspended in the airspace of the public domain and did not reach the ground he rolls it towards him
